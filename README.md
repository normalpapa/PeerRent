PeerRent
PeerRent is a decentralized rental system built on Ethereum using Solidity. It allows users to list items for rent, borrow items by locking collateral, and return items to recover their collateral. The project was developed to gain hands-on experience with smart contract development, testing, and deployment using Hardhat and Ethers.js.

Introduction
PeerRent is designed to create a decentralized marketplace for renting physical items without relying on centralized intermediaries. Users can list their items with a specified collateral amount, and borrowers must lock up an equivalent amount of ETH as collateral when renting an item. Once the item is returned, the collateral is refunded. This basic mechanism can be expanded in the future to include features such as late fees, damage compensation, and dispute resolution through community governance.

Features
Item Listing: Users can list rental items by specifying a collateral value.
Collateral Escrow: When an item is borrowed, the collateral is held securely by the smart contract.
Borrowing and Returning: Borrowers lock up collateral to rent an item and receive it back upon return.
Expandable Design: The contract is designed to be extended with additional features such as rental duration, late fees, dispute resolution, and reputation systems.
Automated Testing: A suite of tests using Hardhat and Ethers.js ensures the contract functions as expected.
Technologies
Solidity: Smart contract programming language.
Hardhat: Ethereum development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying contracts.
Ethers.js: Library for interacting with Ethereum.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime.
GitHub: Version control and project management.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PeerRent.git
cd PeerRent
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add your configuration (for example, your Alchemy API key and private keys):

dotenv
Copy
ALCHEMY_API_KEY="https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY"
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY"
BORROWER_PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_BORROWER_PRIVATE_KEY"
Usage
Listing an Item
When a user (lender) lists an item, they call the listItem function with a specified collateral value. For example, listing an item with 0.001 ETH collateral.

Borrowing an Item
A borrower must provide the exact collateral amount to borrow an item. The collateral is held by the contract until the item is returned.

Returning an Item
When a borrower returns the item, they call the returnItem function. The collateral is then refunded to the borrower.

Testing
The project includes tests written in JavaScript using Hardhat and Ethers.js.

To run the tests, execute:

bash
Copy
npx hardhat test
The tests cover:

Listing an item
Borrowing an item (with collateral locking)
Returning an item (and collateral refund)
Deployment
The contract can be deployed to networks like Sepolia using a deployment script.

To deploy on Sepolia:

bash
Copy
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
Make sure your .env file is properly configured with your API keys and private keys before deploying.

Future Roadmap
Escrow & Collateral Enhancements:
Implement a more robust escrow system that deducts late fees or compensates for item damage.
Rental Duration & Penalties:
Introduce rental time limits, and automatically deduct late fees if items are not returned on time.
Dispute Resolution:
Develop a decentralized dispute resolution mechanism (using community voting or a DAO).
Item Verification & Metadata:
Allow lenders to add detailed item descriptions and images (stored on IPFS) and implement a verification system.
Ratings & Reputation:
Create a karma-based reputation system for both lenders and borrowers.
Frontend Integration:
Build a user-friendly interface using React/Next.js to interact with the smart contract.
